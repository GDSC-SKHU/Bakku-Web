This service is the subject of [Life Below Water](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/14_Why-It-Matters-2020.pdf) among the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.

We thought about raising people's awareness that the sea ecosystem is dangerous and motivating them to solve it.

So the service that we created is **"Bakku"**

Through various functions, we created SNS that is fun and motivating to users.
